            Counting Sheep changes the sleeping mechanic of Stardew Valley; no longer can you just get away with going to bed at 12am and waking up a 6am!

            The penalty for not sleeping enough has been increased from what it is in the base game.
            Getting fewer than 8 hours of sleep will result in starting the next day with 75% of your maximum stamina, and getting fewer than 6 hours will cause you to start at half stamina, so make sure you're taking care of yourself and sleeping enough!
            To offset this, you now have an alarm clock which you'll set before bed each night, allowing you to sleep in if you're up late, or wake up as early as 5am (5am? Wow! A whole extra hour to water your crops, free as long as you're in bed by 9pm!).
